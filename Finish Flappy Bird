//10. Make the pipe teleport back to the right side of the screen once it has passed through the left. This will simulate the repeating pipes coming from the right of the screen.
//Tip: Put this code into a teleportPipes() method and you can also call it from the setup() method to create the first pipes.

//11. Set the upper pipe's height to a new random number each time it teleports

//12. Make a second pipe that does down to the bottom of the sketch. In the draw() method:


//13. Repeat steps 9 & 10 for this pipe.

//14. Create a gap between the pipes.
//The x values of both pipes will be the same.
//Make sure the gap is big enough for the ball to go through.
//Set the lower pipe y value by adding the upper pipe height and pipe gap. Ex:



//15. Make the game end when the bird hits the pipe. Figure it out by yourself, or use this method:

boolean intersectsPipes() { 
  if (BirdY < upperPipeHeight && BirdX > PipeX && BirdX < (PipeX+140)) {
    return true;
  } else if (BirdY> upperPipeHeight + pipegap && BirdX > PipeX && BirdX < (PipeX+140)) {
    return true;
  } else { 
    return false;
  }
}






//16. End the game when the bird hits the ground.
//   Make a rectangle for the ground.



// Use a boolean variable at the top of the sketch to indicate if game has ended.

//17. Create a score and make it increase each time the bird passes through a pipe.

//text(text, xPosition, yPosition);

//18. OPTIONAL. Make a sound when the bird flaps.

//Drop a sound file (Ex. "flap.mp3") onto your sketch.

//import ddf.minim.*;
//Minim minim;  
//AudioSample sound;  
//minim = new Minim (this);
//sound = minim.loadSample("flap.mp3", 128);
//sound.trigger();

//at the very top of your sketch //as a member variable
//as a member variable
//in the setup method
//in the setup method
//in mouseReleased() method (when the bird flaps)
